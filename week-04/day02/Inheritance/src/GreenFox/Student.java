/*Create a Student class that has the same fields and methods as the Person class, and has the following additional

fields:

skippedDays: the number of days skipped from the course
methods:
getGoal(): prints out "Be a junior software developer."
introduce(): "Hi, I'm name, a age year old gender from previousOrganization who skipped skippedDays days from the course already."
skipDays(numberOfDays): increases skippedDays by numberOfDays
The Student class has the following constructors:

Student(name, age, gender, previousOrganization): beside the given parameters, it sets skippedDays to 0
Student(): sets name to Jane Doe, age to 30, gender to female, previousOrganization to The School of Life, skippedDays to 0*/
